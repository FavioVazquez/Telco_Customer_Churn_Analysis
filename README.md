## by Yueh-Han Chen

## Dataset

> "Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets] https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our target.


## Conclusion and Limitation

> Limitation 1 : In this dataset, we can only see one type of each variables instead of real world situation of changing different options as time passes, e.g., in real world, people might wanna try streaming service, but they might change their mind to leave the service next month. 
> Limitation 2 : We cannot only see these variables as whole factors to understand the exact reasons why customers left because they might leave for better price offered by competitors or the bad economy in certian time, etc. We also cannot see the time they leaked, so it's hard to infer those external situation.
